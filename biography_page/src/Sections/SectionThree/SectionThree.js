         Ronaldo made his debut for Sporting CP in the Primeira Liga
        against Moreirense on 7 October 2002. He scored a brace with Sporting
        winning 3-0. He made 25 appearances and scored five goals for the club
        in the 2002-03 season. In a friendly match between Sporting and
        Manchester United in August 2003, Ronaldo contributed greatly to help
        the Portuguese club defeat United 3-1. He impressed manager Sir Alex
        Ferguson and other United players with his pace and dribbling skills. He
        spent just one season with the club before being signed by Manchester
        United, one of the biggest clubs in the world, in 2003 for a transfer
        fee of Â£12.24 million. He made his debut on 16th August 2003 against
        Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League, when he came on as a substitute
        for Nicky Butt. He received a standing ovation as United won 4-0. On
        November 1 2003, Cristiano scored his first goal for the club with a
        free kick in a 3-0 win against Portsmouth.
